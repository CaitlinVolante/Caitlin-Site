I am interested in both typical and atypical populations.\nHonors Thesis\nHigh Rising Terminals as a Function of Gender, Race, and Social Status\nHigh Rising Terminals (HRTs) are a speech feature where there is a rising intonation contour at the end of an utterance where a falling intonation contour would normally be used. Commonly referred to as “uptalk” or “upspeak,” they are lumped together with other negative politeness devices, and proposed to be used as a way for women to make themselves seem less imposing. As a result of this, HRTs are colloquially seen as a sign of uncertainty in female speakers. Despite this common notion, HRTs are used for a range of purposes in conversation. They may signal a topic change, or be used as a way to gauge the listener’s responsiveness or understanding. This project investigated the interplay between race, gender, and social status in the interpretation of HRTs.\nVolante, C. (2022).
