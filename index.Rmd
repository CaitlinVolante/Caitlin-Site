I am a fourth year senior at Florida State University getting my Bachelors in Behavioral Neuroscience. I currently work in Dr. Michael Kaschak's Language, Memory, and Learning Lab studying High Rising Terminals interpretation, and in Dr. Brad Schmidt ABHC Lab where we use EEG as a way to measure PTSD and design new interventions.
